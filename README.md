# LeetCodeNotes
- grind!!!

Good General Approaches
- grid problem with counting -> dfs/bfs/djikstrastras
- grid with optimization -> dp/djikstras
- random array problem -> prefix sum, two pointers, sliding window
- "k highest, k lowest, consider k at a time" -> sliding window with priority queue
- "find two nums, three nums s.t." -> hashmap or sort + hashmap
- "n<=42" => backtracking 2^n solution
- "consecutive element maximum/minimize" -> dp
- "linked list" -> fast slow pointer, recursion
- "tree" -> inorder, preorder, post order traversal
